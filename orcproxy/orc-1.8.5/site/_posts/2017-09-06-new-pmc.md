 On behalf of the Apache ORC Project Management Committee (PMC), it gives
me great pleasure to announce that Eugene Koifman and Deepak Majeti have
joined the PMC. Eugene has been critical working on ACID and Deepak has
been doing great work on the C++ code base.

Please join me in welcoming Eugene and Deepak to the ORC PMC!
