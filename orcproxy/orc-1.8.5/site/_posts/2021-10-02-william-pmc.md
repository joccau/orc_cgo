On behalf of the Apache ORC Project Management Committee (PMC), it gives
me great pleasure to announce that William Hyun has joined the PMC.
William has led several areas including Java 17/Apple Silicon support, Java Tools improvement,
Code quality improvement using static analysis, CI/Docker test coverage improvement,
and Apache ORC 1.7 migration support at Apache Arrow/Druid/Iceberg.

Please join me in welcoming William to the ORC PMC!
